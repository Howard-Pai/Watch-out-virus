# Watch-out-virus
In 2020, as COVID-19 spread globally, we, 4 freshmans from NCCU, decided to create this little game to commemorate this historic year. Players will take on the roles of iconic Taiwanese figures to combat the viruses descending from the sky.  
We used simple Java programming to develop this game.
