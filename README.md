# Watch-out-virus
In 2020, as COVID-19 spread globally, we, 4 students from NCCU, decided to create this little game to commemorate this historic year. Players will take on the roles of iconic Taiwanese figures to combat the viruses descending from the sky.  
We used simple Java programming to develop this game.  
p.s. remember to change the images source path and mySQL path if u need it
